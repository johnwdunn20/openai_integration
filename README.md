# openai_integration
Application to integrate with OpenAI's APIs and support various applications or use cases related to it.  Recommend the following to get started:

1.) Create a virtual environment named "local" to run everything

2.) Utilize the requirements.txt to install all necessary dependencies

3.) Create a "API_KEY.txt" file with your API code from OpenAI (Note: This file and all other contents in the local environment folder are excluded from GitHub for security reasons)

4.) Run "pip install -e ." in your root folder to ensure the main caller package is avaiable to the other applications

After this, the main application are all contained in the "src" folder.  The "caller" application is the main class that any other application or use cases will run off.
